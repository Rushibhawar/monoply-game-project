Decisions and Design Patterns in the application

1. Design Patterns

a. Builder Pattern
Usage: Implemented the Builder pattern for constructing objects like Game and Place entities.
Benefit: Simplifies object creation by allowing flexible construction steps and improving readability.

b. Repository Pattern
Usage: Utilized the Repository pattern with Spring Data JPA to manage data persistence and provide database access.
Benefit: Promotes separation of concerns by isolating data access logic, enabling easier testing and maintenance.

c. Service Layer Pattern
Usage: Implemented a Service layer to encapsulate business logic and coordinate operations between Controllers and Repositories.
Benefit: Enhances modularity, scalability, and reusability by centralizing business rules and operations.

2. Architectural Decisions

a. Layered Architecture
Decision: Adopted a layered architecture with Controller, Service, and Repository layers.
Rationale: Promotes separation of concerns, modularity, and easier maintenance by organizing components based on responsibilities.

b. Dependency Injection (DI)
Decision: Leveraged Spring Boot's dependency injection for managing component dependencies.
Rationale: Improves testability, flexibility, and promotes loose coupling between components.

c. RESTful API Design
Decision: Designed RESTful APIs for handling HTTP requests and responses.
Rationale: Ensures standardization, scalability, and interoperability of the application's API endpoints.

d. Transactional Operations:
Decision: Implemented transaction management for atomicity and consistency of database operations.
Rationale: Used Spring's @Transactional annotation to define transaction boundaries and ensure data integrity.

e. Exception Handling:
Decision: Implemented structured exception handling to manage errors gracefully.
Rationale: Used try-catch blocks and custom exception classes to handle different types of exceptions, providing meaningful error messages.

f. DTO (Data Transfer Object) Pattern:
Decision: Implemented DTOs to transfer data between layers and decouple the presentation layer from the domain model.
Rationale: Created separate DTO classes for request and response payloads, ensuring a clear separation of concerns.
